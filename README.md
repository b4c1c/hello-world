# hello-world

## following the guide to learn using github

**first repo on github**

this is how i started. links are guides:
1. [github quick start](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world)
2. [markdown cheet sheet syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
3. [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax)

git hub will probably take some time to learn and this is good start.

cheers!
